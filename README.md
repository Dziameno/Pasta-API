# PastaWebApp
### Pasta API created as final project for Advanced Java on III SEM PJAIT 

## Technologies used in project
* Java
* Spring Boot
* MySQL
* Thymeleaf + Bootstrap

### Clue of the project was to create a site with pasta recipes where people can find their dinner recipe in easy way. They only need to know what type of pasta they would like to eat. For example you choose vege/meat pasta or noodle type you like and then it's easy to find proper recipe.
